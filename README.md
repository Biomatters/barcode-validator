# barcode-validator

The Barcode Validator is an open source project comissioned and developed in collaboration with the [Consortium for the Barcode of Life](http://www.barcodeoflife.org) (CBOL) at the Smithsonian Institution.

It provides tools to asses the quality of sequencing data for the purposes of validation before submission to GenBank as a barcode record.  

The project currently contains two modules:
* Validation - A pipeline that runs on sequencing data and generates a report listing statistics on the quality of the data.
* Research Tool - A Geneious plugin that provides a user interface for running the validation pipeline in batch for the purposes of identifying ideal thresholds for quality metrics.
